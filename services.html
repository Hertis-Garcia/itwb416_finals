              Academic advising ensures all students are guided by their
              professors in each respective course. Faculty members allot
              consultation hours outside the requisite classroom lectures to
              make themselves available to address other student concerns.
              However, schedules may vary so students should personally
              coordinate and confirm consultation times with their professors.

            <p class="accordion-text">
              A student is considered officially enrolled after making full or
              initial payment of tuition and other fees. A registration
              confirmation slip printed from the online enrollment facility
              (OnE) may be used for payment in accredited payment centers and
              banks or at the University cashiers. Once the University
              officially acknowledges payment ("posting") in OnE, the student
              may print the Certificate of Registration (COR) — Transaction 1.
              Modification and registration of enrolled subjects will mean
              Transaction 2 or 3.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li class="accordion-text">
                A student may only modify registration online if Transaction 1
                is complete (payment posted in OnE).
              </li>
              <li class="accordion-text">
                Students are allowed a maximum of three transactions. A fourth
                transaction may be requested case-by-case via an Enrollment
                Transaction Request Form and is subject to University Registrar
                approval and the corresponding fee.
              </li>
              <li class="accordion-text">
                Students with unpaid balances or old accounts are not allowed to
                enroll until cleared by the Accounting Office.

                Foreign students will be placed on hold and will only be cleared
